When constructing a Linear Regression Model, it is important to consider several assumptions to ensure a better fit for the regression line. Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that utilizes one or more independent variables to explain the dependent (predictor) variable. Here are the six assumptions of linear regression:

Linearity: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is assumed to be linear.

Multicollinearity: The independent variables should not have high correlation with each other, as it can lead to issues of multicollinearity.

Mean of Residuals: The mean of the residuals (the differences between the actual and predicted values) should ideally be close to zero.

Normality of Residuals: The error terms (residuals) are assumed to be normally distributed.

Independence of Error Terms: The error terms should be independent of each other, meaning that the error in one observation should not depend on the errors of other observations.

Homoscedasticity/Heteroscedasticity: Homoscedasticity refers to the assumption that the variance of the error terms is constant across all levels of the independent variables. Heteroscedasticity, on the other hand, occurs when the variance of the error terms is not constant across different levels of the independent variables.

By keeping these assumptions in mind, we can build a more reliable and accurate Linear Regression Model.
